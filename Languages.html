            <h2>JAVA</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.</li>
                <li>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as
                     it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
                <li>The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on 
                    <strong>J</strong>ava 
                    <strong>V</strong>irtual 
                    <strong>M</strong>achine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.</li>
                <li>Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming 
                    functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.</li>
    
                <li>Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop 
                    applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.</li>
                <li>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things
                     which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always
                      references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass 
                      references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.</li>
                <li>When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java typically
                     run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, 
                     but Python does not.</li>

                C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming. 
                It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms 
                like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.

            <p>Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is used to set the style in web pages that contain HTML elements. 
                It sets the background color, font-size, font-family, color, … etc property of elements on
                 a web page.
                 &nbsp;

                 There are three types of CSS which are given below:
                 &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inline CSS</li>
                <li>Internal or Embedded CSS</li>
                <li>External CSS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Inline CSS:</strong> 
                Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body 
                section attached with element is known as inline CSS. 
                This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using 
                the style attribute.&nbsp;

                Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language.
                 Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, 
                 Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. 
                 Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers 
                 with other programming languages like C++ and Java.
    
    
                 <ol>
                    <li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
                    <li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
                    <li>Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.</li>
                    <li>Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</li>
                    <li>The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:
                        <ul>
                    <li>Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)</li>
                    <li>Test frameworks</li>
                    <li>Multimedia</li>
